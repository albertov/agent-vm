# Building a QEMU/KVM VM Management System in Haskell: Libraries and Best Practices

The Haskell ecosystem offers robust libraries and patterns for implementing a VM management system similar to agent-vm. While the virtualization-specific ecosystem is smaller than Python's, Haskell provides superior type safety, composability, and concurrent programming capabilities that make it well-suited for systems programming.

## Process Management and Subprocess Handling

The Haskell ecosystem has evolved significantly beyond the traditional `process` library. **typed-process** emerges as the clear winner for modern process management, offering type-safe streams and excellent concurrency support.

### typed-process (Recommended)
This library provides a composable API with type parameters representing stdin/stdout/stderr types, preventing common process handling errors at compile time. Key advantages include:
- Binary I/O by default using `ByteString` instead of `String`
- Built-in STM support for complex concurrency scenarios
- Automatic resource management with bracket patterns
- No lazy I/O issues

```haskell
-- Type-safe VM command execution
let config = setStdin createPipe 
           $ setStdout byteStringOutput 
           $ proc "qemu-system-x86_64" ["-enable-kvm", "-m", "2048"]
withProcessWait_ config $ \p -> do
    -- Interact with running VM
    output <- atomically (getStdout p)
```

For shell scripting patterns, **turtle** and **shelly** provide type-safe alternatives to traditional shell scripts, with turtle offering a more Unix-like experience and shelly providing comprehensive error handling.

## CLI Development Libraries

### optparse-applicative (Primary Recommendation)
The most popular and actively maintained CLI library uses Applicative combinators for type-safe parsing. It provides automatic help generation, built-in shell completion support, and excellent subcommand handling - perfect for a VM management tool with commands like `vm start`, `vm stop`, etc.

```haskell
data Command 
  = StartVM VMConfig
  | StopVM VMId
  | ListVMs
  
commands :: Parser Command
commands = hsubparser
  ( command "start" (info startOptions (progDesc "Start a VM"))
  <> command "stop" (info stopOptions (progDesc "Stop a VM"))
  <> command "list" (info (pure ListVMs) (progDesc "List all VMs"))
  )
```

For simpler use cases, **cmdargs** offers a more concise annotation-based approach, though with less type safety.

## QEMU/KVM Virtualization Libraries

The Haskell ecosystem for direct QEMU/KVM control is limited but includes some innovative approaches:

### libvirt-hs
Basic FFI bindings to libvirt provide direct access to virtualization APIs. While low-level (version 0.1), it offers core types like `Connection`, `Domain`, and `Network` for VM management.

### B9 VM Image Builder
A comprehensive tool featuring an embedded DSL for VM image generation. It supports multiple formats (QCOW2, VMDK, RAW), integrates with libvirt, and uses Shake for incremental builds. This represents a more Haskell-idiomatic approach with declarative configuration.

### Notable Gaps
- No dedicated QEMU Machine Protocol (QMP) client libraries
- Limited high-level QEMU command-line wrappers
- Most projects remain at research/prototype stage

The recommendation is to either use libvirt-hs for basic operations or implement custom QMP protocol handling using Haskell's excellent networking libraries.

## JSON and Configuration Management

### Aeson (JSON Standard)
The industry standard for JSON processing in Haskell, with excellent Generic deriving support and a 4-5x performance improvement in recent versions. Integrates seamlessly with YAML through the yaml package.

### Configuration Libraries
**Configurator** stands out for traditional applications with features like automatic file reloading, string interpolation from environment variables, and subscription-based change notifications. For more complex configurations, **Dhall** offers a programmable, type-safe configuration language that compiles to JSON/YAML.

```haskell
-- Type-safe VM configuration with Aeson
data VMConfig = VMConfig
  { vmName :: Text
  , vmMemory :: Int
  , vmCpus :: Int
  , vmDiskPath :: FilePath
  } deriving (Generic, FromJSON, ToJSON)
```

## SSH Client Capabilities

### libssh2 Bindings
The primary option for SSH client functionality, providing mature FFI bindings with complete SSH2 protocol support, public key and password authentication, SCP/SFTP support, and non-blocking operations. While requiring an external C library, it's production-ready and actively maintained.

Unfortunately, no pure Haskell SSH client implementation exists - **hssh** only provides server-side functionality.

## Logging and Terminal Output

### ansi-terminal + katip
For colored terminal output, **ansi-terminal** is essential, providing cross-platform ANSI escape code support. Combine with **katip** for structured logging - a battle-tested framework with JSON output, multiple backends, and contextual logging capabilities.

```haskell
-- Colored VM status output
setSGR [SetColor Foreground Vivid Green]
putStr "● "
setSGR [Reset]
putStrLn $ "VM " ++ vmName ++ " started successfully"
```

For progress indicators during long operations like VM provisioning, **terminal-progress-bar** provides animated progress bars with ETA calculation.

## Concurrent VM Lifecycle Management

Haskell excels at concurrent programming, offering several powerful patterns for VM management:

### async + STM Pattern
Software Transactional Memory (STM) eliminates deadlocks and provides composable concurrency, ideal for managing VM state:

```haskell
data VMRegistry = VMRegistry (TVar (Map VMId (TVar VMState)))

-- Atomic VM state transitions
migrateVM :: VMRegistry -> VMId -> VMId -> STM ()
migrateVM registry sourceId targetId = do
  sourceState <- readVMState registry sourceId
  check (sourceState == Running)
  updateVMState registry sourceId Paused
  updateVMState registry targetId Running
```

### Supervisor Trees with Capataz
For fault-tolerant VM management, **Capataz** provides OTP-like supervision trees with restart strategies and complete telemetry:

```haskell
vmSupervisor :: IO (Capataz ())
vmSupervisor = forkCapataz $ do
  _ <- forkWorker "vm-monitor" vmMonitoringService
  _ <- forkWorker "vm-provisioner" vmProvisioningService
  _ <- forkWorker "vm-cleanup" vmCleanupService
```

### Type-Safe State Machines
Use phantom types to encode VM states and prevent invalid transitions at compile time:

```haskell
data VM (s :: VMState) = VM { vmId :: VMId, vmConfig :: VMConfig }

startVM :: VM 'Stopped -> IO (VM 'Running)
stopVM :: VM 'Running -> IO (VM 'Stopped)
-- Cannot compile: stopVM :: VM 'Stopped -> IO (VM 'Stopped)
```

## Type-Safe System Administration

### Shell DSLs
**Turtle** and **Shelly** provide type-safe alternatives to shell scripting. Turtle offers a more Unix-like experience:

```haskell
deploymentScript :: IO ()
deploymentScript = sh $ do
  files <- find (suffix ".conf") "/etc/myapp"
  exitcode <- proc "systemctl" ["restart", "myapp"] empty
  case exitcode of
    ExitSuccess -> echo "Service restarted"
    ExitFailure n -> die ("Failed with code " <> repr n)
```

### Build System Integration
**Shake** provides a Haskell DSL for build systems with monadic dependencies, perfect for VM image building pipelines.

## System Programming Best Practices

### Error Handling
Distinguish between four types of errors:
1. Pure errors (`Maybe`, `Either`) for expected failures
2. Imprecise exceptions for programming errors
3. Synchronous exceptions for IO issues
4. Asynchronous exceptions for thread cancellation

### Resource Management
Always use bracket patterns for automatic cleanup:
```haskell
withVMConnection :: VMConfig -> (VMConnection -> IO a) -> IO a
withVMConnection config = bracket
  (openVMConnection config)
  closeVMConnection
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use `ByteString` over `String` for I/O operations
- Enable threaded runtime: `ghc-options: -threaded -rtsopts`
- Leverage lightweight threads (1KB each) for massive concurrency
- Use STM for lock-free concurrent data structures

## Example Architecture

A production VM management system might combine these libraries:

```haskell
-- Complete VM management stack
dependencies:
  - typed-process        # Process management
  - optparse-applicative # CLI parsing
  - libvirt-hs          # Libvirt bindings
  - aeson               # JSON configuration
  - configurator        # Config management
  - libssh2             # SSH connections
  - katip               # Structured logging
  - ansi-terminal       # Colored output
  - async               # Concurrent operations
  - stm                 # Transactional memory
  - capataz             # Supervision trees
```

## Conclusion

While Haskell's virtualization ecosystem is smaller than Python's, it offers superior type safety, composability, and concurrent programming capabilities. The combination of typed-process for subprocess management, STM for state coordination, supervision trees for fault tolerance, and type-safe shell DSLs creates a robust foundation for VM management systems. The main trade-off is the need to implement some low-level integrations (like QMP clients) yourself, but Haskell's strong FFI support and excellent networking libraries make this straightforward.

The key advantages of a Haskell implementation include compile-time prevention of many runtime errors, superior concurrency handling for managing multiple VMs, and the ability to build highly reliable systems through functional programming principles and strong static typing.
